## Navigation

Our code bases are organized by year, by robot, and then into frameworks (robot code) and dashboard projects (run on the driver station.)  
We have separate code bases for every year's robot, and often we will rewrite last year's code as practice and training.
  - **Victoria** - robot code for Victoria, our 2017 robot.
  - **Morgana** - robot code for Morgana, our 2016 robot.
  - **Bonnie** - robot code for Bonnie, our 2015 robot.
  - **Clyde** - robot code for Clyde, our 2015 practice bot.
  - **Annie** - robot code for Annie, our 2014 robot.
  - **Kari** - robot code for Kari, our 2014 practice bot.
  - **Sally** - robot code for Sally, our 2013 robot.
  - **Lucy** - robot code for Lucy, our 2012 robot.
  - **Sarek** - robot code for Sarek, our 2010 robot. (Probably broken beyond repair.)
